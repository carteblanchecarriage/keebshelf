Hello! I see this is a mechanical keyboard tracker project. Let me help with the assigned task.

Looking at my previous work, I'm implementing the '/' keyboard shortcut to focus the search input. I've already:
1. Added the JavaScript event listener that triggers on `/` keypress
2. Updated the placeholder text to hint at the shortcut
3. Included logic to avoid triggering when in input fields or modals

Now I need to verify the changes work and commit them.
