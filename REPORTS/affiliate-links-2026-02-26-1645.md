## 2. MISSING TRACKING CODES ⚠️

### Static Guide Pages — MEDIUM PRIORITY
- **Root Cause:** Manual HTML pages use relative navigation instead of direct affiliate URLs
- **Pages Affected:**
  - `/best/index.html` — 4× "Check Current Price" buttons link to `../` (home)
- **Impact:** Guide visitors navigate to homepage instead of direct vendor links
- **Recommendation:** Connect buttons to `/api/redirect` endpoints or add affiliate parameters

### Amazon Associates — NOT DETECTED
- **Status:** No Amazon links found in current `/best/index.html`
- **Previous Issue:** Earlier reports mentioned 8+ Amazon search links without `tag=` parameter
- **Current State:** ✅ Appears resolved or removed
