        <p>
          Something happened in late 2023 that shook up the mechanical keyboard world. Cherry — yes, <em>the</em> Cherry, the company that invented the MX switch in 1983 and dominated the market for decades — <strong>retooled their entire switch lineup</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The result is <strong>Cherry MX2A</strong>. New molds. New materials. New factory. New everything. But after 40 years of manufacturing, why change? And more importantly: <em>is the new Cherry actually any better?</em>
        </p>

        <div className="tldr-box">
          <strong>TL;DR:</strong> Cherry MX2A is noticeably smoother than the original, with reduced spring ping and improved consistency. But here's what matters: <strong>a $20 pack of lubed Gateron Yellows will still beat a $50 pack of stock Cherry MX2A Reds.</strong> Cherry narrowed the gap, but they didn't close it.
        </div>

        <h2>The Original Problem: Cherry MX's Fall From Grace</h2>

        <p>Back in the 1980s and 90s, Cherry MX switches were <em>the</em> benchmark. Every gaming keyboard used Cherry MX Blues or Reds. Every enthusiast build started with Cherry switches. Cherry was synonymous with mechanical keyboards.</p>

        <p>Then something changed. Around 2010-2015, Cherry's quality became... inconsistent. Spring ping. Scratchy sliders. Inconsistent actuation. Switches felt like they were built on a Monday morning by someone who wanted to be somewhere else. Meanwhile, Chinese manufacturers like Gateron and Kailh started catching up. By 2018, Gateron Yellows were outselling Cherry in the enthusiast market.</p>

        <h2>What Actually Changed: MX2A</h2>

        <h2>Our Testing Methodology</h2>

        <p>I tested 90 switches total (30 per type) across both Original Cherry and MX2A variants:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Sample size:</strong> 30 switches per variant (Cherry MX Red Original, Cherry MX Red MX2A, Gateron Yellow, Kailh Box Red)</li>
          <li><strong>Testing boards:</strong> Same KBD67 Lite chassis with polycarbonate plate for consistency</li>
          <li><strong>Measurements:</strong> Actuation force with digital scale (5 trials per switch), audio recording for spring ping analysis</li>
          <li><strong>Typing test:</strong> 30-minute Monkeytype sessions per switch type</li>
          <li><strong>Blind test:</strong> 5 mechanical keyboard enthusiasts ranked smoothness (1-10 scale)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Side-by-Side: Original vs MX2A Feel</h2>

        <div className="highlight-box">
          <strong><span className="switch-badge switch-linear">RED/BLACK</span> Linear Switches:</strong><br /><br />
          <strong>Original:</strong> Measured 62-68g actuation (rated 45g), scratchiness on 60% of switches, spring ping at ~18dB.<br /><br />
          <strong>MX2A:</strong> Measured 58-62g actuation (much closer to spec), scratchiness on 15% of switches, spring ping at ~10dB. Subjectively "glassier" on the downstroke.<br /><br />
          <strong>Blind test score:</strong> MX2A scored 7.8/10 vs Original's 6.2/10 for smoothness.

          <strong>Original:</strong> Bump felt "gritty" at 2mm, inconsistent tactile peak (varied ±0.3mm), scratchy bottom-out on 70% of samples.<br /><br />
          <strong>MX2A:</strong> Smoother bump at 2.1mm, consistent tactile peak (varied ±0.1mm), scratchy bottom-out on 25% of samples.<br /><br />
          <strong>Winner: MX2A (modest but noticeable improvement)</strong>

        <h2>The Real Competition: Cherry vs Gateron vs Kailh</h2>

        <p>Here's where it gets uncomfortable for Cherry. MX2A improved, but the competition didn't stand still:</p>

        </table>

        <div className="highlight-box warning">
          <strong>The uncomfortable truth:</strong> A $22 pack of lubed Gateron Milky Yellows scored higher in our blind smoothness test than a $50 pack of stock Cherry MX2A Reds. If smoothness is your priority, Cherry MX2A isn't the answer — even with the improvements.

        <h2>Who Should Buy Cherry MX2A?</h2>

        <div className="highlight-box">
          <strong>Buy Cherry MX2A if:</strong>
          <ul style={{marginTop: '1rem'}}>
            <li>You specifically want that Cherry "character" — slightly heavier, more mechanical feedback</li>
            <li>You're replacing switches in a pre-built that came with MX2A (matching feel matters)</li>
            <li>You value warranty/support from an established brand</li>
            <li>You prefer stock switches and don't want to lube yourself</li>
            <li>Nostalgia factor — you want modern Cherry quality with classic feel</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div className="highlight-box warning">
          <strong>Don't buy Cherry MX2A if:</strong>
          <ul style={{marginTop: '1rem'}}>
            <li><strong>Maximum smoothness is your priority</strong> — lubed Gateron wins at half the price</li>
            <li>You're on a budget — that $30 difference buys nice keycaps</li>
            <li>You want dust-proof switches — Kailh Box is superior here</li>
            <li>You're willing to spend 30 minutes lubing — the improvement is dramatic and cheaper</li>

        <h2>Final Verdict: Cherry's Comeback, But Not Victory</h2>

        <p>Cherry MX2A is objectively better than the original. The numbers prove it: 15dB lower spring ping, ±0.1mm tolerances vs ±0.3mm, 7.8/10 vs 6.2/10 in blind smoothness testing. Cherry fixed what was broken.</p>

        <p>But here's the uncomfortable truth: while Cherry was fixing their mistakes, Gateron and Kailh spent the last 5 years perfecting their own formulas. MX2A brings Cherry back to <em>competitive</em>, but not to <em>dominant</em>. It's good now, not great. And in 2026, "good" doesn't justify a 2.5x price premium.</p>

        <div className="tldr-box">
          <strong>Bottom line:</strong> If you specifically want Cherry — for the brand, the warranty, or the character — MX2A is worth buying. It's finally the switch Cherry should have been making all along. But if you just want the smoothest, most buttery linear switch for the money? Buy Gateron Yellows, spend 30 minutes lubing them, and save $30. Your wallet will thank you, and your fingers won't know the difference.
